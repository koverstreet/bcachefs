	  Management Component Transport Protocol (MCTP) is an in-system
	  protocol for communicating between management controllers and
	  their managed devices (peripherals, host processors, etc.). The
	  protocol is defined by DMTF specification DSP0236.

	  This option enables core MCTP support. For communicating with other
	  devices, you'll want to enable a driver for a specific hardware
	  channel.
