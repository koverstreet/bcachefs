	help
	  EROFS (Enhanced Read-Only File System) is a lightweight read-only
	  file system with modern designs (e.g. no buffer heads, inline
	  xattrs/data, chunk-based deduplication, multiple devices, etc.) for
	  scenarios which need high-performance read-only solutions, e.g.
	  smartphones with Android OS, LiveCDs and high-density hosts with
	  numerous containers;

	  It also provides fixed-sized output compression support in order to
	  improve storage density as well as keep relatively higher compression
	  ratios and implements in-place decompression to reuse the file page
	  for compressed data temporarily with proper strategies, which is
	  quite useful to ensure guaranteed end-to-end runtime decompression
	  performance under extremely memory pressure without extra cost.

	  See the documentation at <file:Documentation/filesystems/erofs.rst>
	  for more details.

	  If unsure, say N.

config EROFS_FS_DEBUG
	bool "EROFS debugging feature"
	depends on EROFS_FS
	help
	  Print debugging messages and enable more BUG_ONs which check
	  filesystem consistency and find potential issues aggressively,
	  which can be used for Android eng build, for example.

	  For daily use, say N.

config EROFS_FS_XATTR
	bool "EROFS extended attributes"
	depends on EROFS_FS
	default y
	help
	  Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes by
	  the kernel or by users (see the attr(5) manual page, or visit
	  <http://acl.bestbits.at/> for details).

	  If unsure, say N.

config EROFS_FS_POSIX_ACL
	bool "EROFS Access Control Lists"
	depends on EROFS_FS_XATTR
	select FS_POSIX_ACL
	default y
	help
	  Posix Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and
	  groups beyond the owner/group/world scheme.

	  To learn more about Access Control Lists, visit the POSIX ACLs for
	  Linux website <http://acl.bestbits.at/>.

	  If you don't know what Access Control Lists are, say N.

config EROFS_FS_SECURITY
	bool "EROFS Security Labels"
	depends on EROFS_FS_XATTR
	default y
	help
	  Security labels provide an access control facility to support Linux
	  Security Models (LSMs) accepted by AppArmor, SELinux, Smack and TOMOYO
	  Linux. This option enables an extended attribute handler for file
	  security labels in the erofs filesystem, so that it requires enabling
	  the extended attribute support in advance.

	  If you are not using a security module, say N.

config EROFS_FS_ZIP
	bool "EROFS Data Compression Support"
	depends on EROFS_FS
	select LZ4_DECOMPRESS
	default y
	help
	  Enable fixed-sized output compression for EROFS.

	  If you don't want to enable compression feature, say N.

config EROFS_FS_ZIP_LZMA
	bool "EROFS LZMA compressed data support"
	depends on EROFS_FS_ZIP
	select XZ_DEC
	select XZ_DEC_MICROLZMA
	help
	  Saying Y here includes support for reading EROFS file systems
	  containing LZMA compressed data, specifically called microLZMA. it
	  gives better compression ratios than the LZ4 algorithm, at the
	  expense of more CPU overhead.

	  LZMA support is an experimental feature for now and so most file
	  systems will be readable without selecting this option.

	  If unsure, say N.
