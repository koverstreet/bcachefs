/*
 * BKEYS:
 *
 * A bkey contains a key, a size field, a variable number of pointers, and some
 * ancillary flag bits.
 *
 * We use two different functions for validating bkeys, bkey_invalid and
 * bkey_deleted().
 *
 * The one exception to the rule that ptr_invalid() filters out invalid keys is
 * that it also filters out keys of size 0 - these are keys that have been
 * completely overwritten. It'd be safe to delete these in memory while leaving
 * them on disk, just unnecessary work - so we filter them out when resorting
 * instead.
 *
 * We can't filter out stale keys when we're resorting, because garbage
 * collection needs to find them to ensure bucket gens don't wrap around -
 * unless we're rewriting the btree node those stale keys still exist on disk.
 *
 * We also implement functions here for removing some number of sectors from the
 * front or the back of a bkey - this is mainly used for fixing overlapping
 * extents, by removing the overlapping sectors from the older key.
 *
 * BSETS:
 *
 * A bset is an array of bkeys laid out contiguously in memory in sorted order,
 * along with a header. A btree node is made up of a number of these, written at
 * different times.
 *
 * There could be many of them on disk, but we never allow there to be more than
 * 4 in memory - we lazily resort as needed.
 *
 * We implement code here for creating and maintaining auxiliary search trees
 * (described below) for searching an individial bset, and on top of that we
 * implement a btree iterator.
 *
 * BTREE ITERATOR:
 *
 * Most of the code in bcache doesn't care about an individual bset - it needs
 * to search entire btree nodes and iterate over them in sorted order.
 *
 * The btree iterator code serves both functions; it iterates through the keys
 * in a btree node in sorted order, starting from either keys after a specific
 * point (if you pass it a search key) or the start of the btree node.
 *
 * AUXILIARY SEARCH TREES:
 *
 * Since keys are variable length, we can't use a binary search on a bset - we
 * wouldn't be able to find the start of the next key. But binary searches are
 * slow anyways, due to terrible cache behaviour; bcache originally used binary
 * searches and that code topped out at under 50k lookups/second.
 *
 * So we need to construct some sort of lookup table. Since we only insert keys
 * into the last (unwritten) set, most of the keys within a given btree node are
 * usually in sets that are mostly constant. We use two different types of
 * lookup tables to take advantage of this.
 *
 * Both lookup tables share in common that they don't index every key in the
 * set; they index one key every BSET_CACHELINE bytes, and then a linear search
 * is used for the rest.
 *
 * For sets that have been written to disk and are no longer being inserted
 * into, we construct a binary search tree in an array - traversing a binary
 * search tree in an array gives excellent locality of reference and is very
 * fast, since both children of any node are adjacent to each other in memory
 * (and their grandchildren, and great grandchildren...) - this means
 * prefetching can be used to great effect.
 *
 * It's quite useful performance wise to keep these nodes small - not just
 * because they're more likely to be in L2, but also because we can prefetch
 * more nodes on a single cacheline and thus prefetch more iterations in advance
 * when traversing this tree.
 *
 * Nodes in the auxiliary search tree must contain both a key to compare against
 * (we don't want to fetch the key from the set, that would defeat the purpose),
 * and a pointer to the key. We use a few tricks to compress both of these.
 *
 * To compress the pointer, we take advantage of the fact that one node in the
 * search tree corresponds to precisely BSET_CACHELINE bytes in the set. We have
 * a function (to_inorder()) that takes the index of a node in a binary tree and
 * returns what its index would be in an inorder traversal, so we only have to
 * store the low bits of the offset.
 *
 * The key is 84 bits (KEY_DEV + key->key, the offset on the device). To
 * compress that,  we take advantage of the fact that when we're traversing the
 * search tree at every iteration we know that both our search key and the key
 * we're looking for lie within some range - bounded by our previous
 * comparisons. (We special case the start of a search so that this is true even
 * at the root of the tree).
 *
 * So we know the key we're looking for is between a and b, and a and b don't
 * differ higher than bit 50, we don't need to check anything higher than bit
 * 50.
 *
 * We don't usually need the rest of the bits, either; we only need enough bits
 * to partition the key range we're currently checking.  Consider key n - the
 * key our auxiliary search tree node corresponds to, and key p, the key
 * immediately preceding n.  The lowest bit we need to store in the auxiliary
 * search tree is the highest bit that differs between n and p.
 *
 * Note that this could be bit 0 - we might sometimes need all 80 bits to do the
 * comparison. But we'd really like our nodes in the auxiliary search tree to be
 * of fixed size.
 *
 * The solution is to make them fixed size, and when we're constructing a node
 * check if p and n differed in the bits we needed them to. If they don't we
 * flag that node, and when doing lookups we fallback to comparing against the
 * real key. As long as this doesn't happen to often (and it seems to reliably
 * happen a bit less than 1% of the time), we win - even on failures, that key
 * is then more likely to be in cache than if we were doing binary searches all
 * the way, since we're touching so much less memory.
 *
 * The keys in the auxiliary search tree are stored in (software) floating
 * point, with an exponent and a mantissa. The exponent needs to be big enough
 * to address all the bits in the original key, but the number of bits in the
 * mantissa is somewhat arbitrary; more bits just gets us fewer failures.
 *
 * We need 7 bits for the exponent and 3 bits for the key's offset (since keys
 * are 8 byte aligned); using 22 bits for the mantissa means a node is 4 bytes.
 * We need one node per 128 bytes in the btree node, which means the auxiliary
 * search trees take up 3% as much memory as the btree itself.
 *
 * Constructing these auxiliary search trees is moderately expensive, and we
 * don't want to be constantly rebuilding the search tree for the last set
 * whenever we insert another key into it. For the unwritten set, we use a much
 * simpler lookup table - it's just a flat array, so index i in the lookup table
 * corresponds to the i range of BSET_CACHELINE bytes in the set. Indexing
 * within each byte range works the same as with the auxiliary search trees.
 *
 * These are much easier to keep up to date when we insert a key - we do it
 * somewhat lazily; when we shift a key up we usually just increment the pointer
 * to it, only when it would overflow do we go to the trouble of finding the
 * first key in that range of bytes again.
