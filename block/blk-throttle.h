/*
 * To implement hierarchical throttling, throtl_grps form a tree and bios
 * are dispatched upwards level by level until they reach the top and get
 * issued.  When dispatching bios from the children and local group at each
 * level, if the bios are dispatched into a single bio_list, there's a risk
 * of a local or child group which can queue many bios at once filling up
 * the list starving others.
 *
 * To avoid such starvation, dispatched bios are queued separately
 * according to where they came from.  When they are again dispatched to
 * the parent, they're popped in round-robin order so that no single source
 * hogs the dispatch window.
 *
 * throtl_qnode is used to keep the queued bios separated by their sources.
 * Bios are queued to throtl_qnode which in turn is queued to
 * throtl_service_queue and then dispatched in round-robin order.
 *
 * It's also used to track the reference counts on blkg's.  A qnode always
 * belongs to a throtl_grp and gets queued on itself or the parent, so
 * incrementing the reference of the associated throtl_grp when a qnode is
 * queued and decrementing when dequeued is enough to keep the whole blkg
 * tree pinned while bios are in flight.
