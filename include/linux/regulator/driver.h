 * @reread_ms:	The time which is waited before attempting to re-read status

 *		if time is not specified.
 * @irq_off_ms:	The time which IRQ is kept disabled before re-evaluating the
 *		status for devices which keep IRQ disabled for duration of the
 *		error. If this is not given the IRQ is left enabled and renable
 *		is not called.
 * @skip_off:	If set to true the IRQ handler will attempt to check if any of
 *		the associated regulators are enabled prior to taking other
 *		actions. If no regulators are enabled and this is set to true
 *		a spurious IRQ is assumed and IRQ_NONE is returned.
 * @high_prio:	Boolean to indicate that high priority WQ should be used.
 * @data:	Driver private data pointer which will be passed as such to
 *		the renable, map_event and die callbacks in regulator_irq_data.
 * @die:	Protection callback. If IC status reading or recovery actions
 *		fail fatal_cnt times this callback is called or system is
 *		powered off. This callback should implement a final protection
 *		attempt like disabling the regulator. If protection succeeded
 *		die() may return 0. If anything else is returned the core
 *		assumes final protection failed and attempts to perform a
 *		poweroff as a last resort.
 * @map_event:	Driver callback to map IRQ status into regulator devices with
 *		events / errors. NOTE: callback MUST initialize both the
 *		errors and notifs for all rdevs which it signals having
 *		active events as core does not clean the map data.
 *		REGULATOR_FAILED_RETRY can be returned to indicate that the
 *		status reading from IC failed. If this is repeated for
 *		fatal_cnt times the core will call die() callback or power-off
 *		the system as a last resort to protect the HW.
 * @renable:	Optional callback to check status (if HW supports that) before
 *		re-enabling IRQ. If implemented this should clear the error
 *		flags so that errors fetched by regulator_get_error_flags()
 *		are updated. If callback is not implemented then errors are
 *		assumed to be cleared and IRQ is re-enabled.
 *		REGULATOR_FAILED_RETRY can be returned to
 *		indicate that the status reading from IC failed. If this is
 *		repeated for 'fatal_cnt' times the core will call die()
 *		callback or if die() is not populated then attempt to power-off
 *		the system as a last resort to protect the HW.
 *		Returning zero indicates that the problem in HW has been solved
 *		and IRQ will be re-enabled. Returning REGULATOR_ERROR_ON
 *		indicates the error condition is still active and keeps IRQ
 *		disabled. Please note that returning REGULATOR_ERROR_ON does
 *		not retrigger evaluating what events are active or resending
 *		notifications. If this is needed you probably want to return
 *		zero and allow IRQ to retrigger causing events to be
 *		re-evaluated and re-sent.
