- The Frame Interval Monitor could be exported to v4l2-core for
  general use.

- The CSI subdevice parses its nearest upstream neighbor's device-tree
  bus config in order to setup the CSI. Laurent Pinchart argues that
  instead the CSI subdev should call its neighbor's g_mbus_config op
  (which should be propagated if necessary) to get this info. However
  Hans Verkuil is planning to remove the g_mbus_config op. For now this
  driver uses the parsed DT bus config method until this issue is
  resolved.

- This media driver supports inheriting V4L2 controls to the
  video capture devices, from the subdevices in the capture device's
  pipeline. The controls for each capture device are updated in the
  link_notify callback when the pipeline is modified. It should be
  decided whether this feature is useful enough to make it generally
  available by exporting to v4l2-core.

- i.MX7: all of the above, since it uses the imx media core

- i.MX7: use Frame Interval Monitor

- i.MX7: runtime testing with parallel sensor, links setup and streaming

- i.MX7: runtime testing with different formats, for the time only 10-bit bayer
  is tested
