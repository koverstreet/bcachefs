TODO list
* Currently driver supports Tegra build-in TPG only with direct media links
  from CSI to VI. Add kernel config CONFIG_VIDEO_TEGRA_TPG and update the
  driver to do TPG Vs Sensor media links based on CONFIG_VIDEO_TEGRA_TPG.
* Add real camera sensor capture support.
* Add Tegra CSI MIPI pads calibration.
* Add MIPI clock Settle time computation based on the data rate.
* Add support for Ganged mode.
* Add RAW10 packed video format support to Tegra210 video formats.
* Add support for suspend and resume.
* Make sure v4l2-compliance tests pass with all of the above implementations.
