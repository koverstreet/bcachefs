	 * @cache_coherent:

	 * @cache_level setting.
	 *
	 * On platforms which don't have the shared LLC(HAS_SNOOP), like on Atom
	 * platforms, coherency must be explicitly requested with some special
	 * GTT caching bits(see enum i915_cache_level). When enabling coherency
	 * it does come at a performance and power cost on such platforms. On
	 * the flip side the kernel does not need to manually flush any buffers
	 * which need to be coherent with the GPU, if the object is not coherent
	 * i.e @cache_coherent is zero.
	 *
	 * On platforms that share the LLC with the CPU(HAS_LLC), all GT memory
	 * access will automatically snoop the CPU caches(even with CACHE_NONE).
	 * The one exception is when dealing with the display engine, like with
	 * scanout surfaces. To handle this the kernel will always flush the
	 * surface out of the CPU caches when preparing it for scanout.  Also
	 * note that since scanout surfaces are only ever read by the display
	 * engine we only need to care about flushing any writes through the CPU
	 * cache, reads on the other hand will always be coherent.
	 *
	 * Something strange here is why @cache_coherent is not a simple
	 * boolean, i.e coherent vs non-coherent. The reasoning for this is back
	 * to the display engine not being fully coherent. As a result scanout
	 * surfaces will either be marked as I915_CACHE_NONE or I915_CACHE_WT.
	 * In the case of seeing I915_CACHE_NONE the kernel makes the assumption
	 * that this is likely a scanout surface, and will set @cache_coherent
	 * as only I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ, on platforms with the shared
	 * LLC. The kernel uses this to always flush writes through the CPU
	 * cache as early as possible, where it can, in effect keeping
	 * @cache_dirty clean, so we can potentially avoid stalling when
	 * flushing the surface just before doing the scanout.  This does mean
	 * we might unnecessarily flush non-scanout objects in some places, but
	 * the default assumption is that all normal objects should be using
	 * I915_CACHE_LLC, at least on platforms with the shared LLC.
	 *
	 * Supported values:
	 *
	 * I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ:
	 *
	 * On shared LLC platforms, we use this for special scanout surfaces,
	 * where the display engine is not coherent with the CPU cache. As such
	 * we need to ensure we flush any writes before doing the scanout. As an
	 * optimisation we try to flush any writes as early as possible to avoid
	 * stalling later.
	 *
	 * Thus for scanout surfaces using I915_CACHE_NONE, on shared LLC
	 * platforms, we use:
	 *
	 *	cache_coherent = I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ
	 *
	 * While for normal objects that are fully coherent, including special
	 * scanout surfaces marked as I915_CACHE_WT, we use:
	 *
	 *	cache_coherent = I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ |
	 *			 I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_WRITE
	 *
	 * And then for objects that are not coherent at all we use:
	 *
	 *	cache_coherent = 0
	 *
	 * I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_WRITE:
	 *
	 * When writing through the CPU cache, the GPU is still coherent. Note
	 * that this also implies I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_READ.

	/**
	 * @cache_dirty:
	 *
	 * Track if we are we dirty with writes through the CPU cache for this
	 * object. As a result reading directly from main memory might yield
	 * stale data.
	 *
	 * This also ties into whether the kernel is tracking the object as
	 * coherent with the GPU, as per @cache_coherent, as it determines if
	 * flushing might be needed at various points.
	 *
	 * Another part of @cache_dirty is managing flushing when first
	 * acquiring the pages for system memory, at this point the pages are
	 * considered foreign, so the default assumption is that the cache is
	 * dirty, for example the page zeroing done by the kernel might leave
	 * writes though the CPU cache, or swapping-in, while the actual data in
	 * main memory is potentially stale.  Note that this is a potential
	 * security issue when dealing with userspace objects and zeroing. Now,
	 * whether we actually need apply the big sledgehammer of flushing all
	 * the pages on acquire depends on if @cache_coherent is marked as
	 * I915_BO_CACHE_COHERENT_FOR_WRITE, i.e that the GPU will be coherent
	 * for both reads and writes though the CPU cache.
	 *
	 * Note that on shared LLC platforms we still apply the heavy flush for
	 * I915_CACHE_NONE objects, under the assumption that this is going to
	 * be used for scanout.
	 *
	 * Update: On some hardware there is now also the 'Bypass LLC' MOCS
	 * entry, which defeats our @cache_coherent tracking, since userspace
	 * can freely bypass the CPU cache when touching the pages with the GPU,
	 * where the kernel is completely unaware. On such platform we need
	 * apply the sledgehammer-on-acquire regardless of the @cache_coherent.
	 *
	 * Special care is taken on non-LLC platforms, to prevent potential
	 * information leak. The driver currently ensures:
	 *
	 *   1. All userspace objects, by default, have @cache_level set as
	 *   I915_CACHE_NONE. The only exception is userptr objects, where we
	 *   instead force I915_CACHE_LLC, but we also don't allow userspace to
	 *   ever change the @cache_level for such objects. Another special case
	 *   is dma-buf, which doesn't rely on @cache_dirty,  but there we
	 *   always do a forced flush when acquiring the pages, if there is a
	 *   chance that the pages can be read directly from main memory with
	 *   the GPU.
	 *
	 *   2. All I915_CACHE_NONE objects have @cache_dirty initially true.
	 *
	 *   3. All swapped-out objects(i.e shmem) have @cache_dirty set to
	 *   true.
	 *
	 *   4. The @cache_dirty is never freely reset before the initial
	 *   flush, even if userspace adjusts the @cache_level through the
	 *   i915_gem_set_caching_ioctl.
	 *
	 *   5. All @cache_dirty objects(including swapped-in) are initially
	 *   flushed with a synchronous call to drm_clflush_sg in
	 *   __i915_gem_object_set_pages. The @cache_dirty can be freely reset
