/**
 * DOC: GuC-based command submission
 *
 * IMPORTANT NOTE: GuC submission is currently not supported in i915. The GuC
 * firmware is moving to an updated submission interface and we plan to
 * turn submission back on when that lands. The below documentation (and related
 * code) matches the old submission model and will be updated as part of the
 * upgrade to the new flow.
 *
 * GuC stage descriptor:
 * During initialization, the driver allocates a static pool of 1024 such
 * descriptors, and shares them with the GuC. Currently, we only use one
 * descriptor. This stage descriptor lets the GuC know about the workqueue and
 * process descriptor. Theoretically, it also lets the GuC know about our HW
 * contexts (context ID, etc...), but we actually employ a kind of submission
 * where the GuC uses the LRCA sent via the work item instead. This is called
 * a "proxy" submission.
 *
 * The Scratch registers:
 * There are 16 MMIO-based registers start from 0xC180. The kernel driver writes
 * a value to the action register (SOFT_SCRATCH_0) along with any data. It then
 * triggers an interrupt on the GuC via another register write (0xC4C8).
 * Firmware writes a success/fail code back to the action register after
 * processes the request. The kernel driver polls waiting for this update and
 * then proceeds.
 *
 * Work Items:
 * There are several types of work items that the host may place into a
 * workqueue, each with its own requirements and limitations. Currently only
 * WQ_TYPE_INORDER is needed to support legacy submission via GuC, which
 * represents in-order queue. The kernel driver packs ring tail pointer and an
 * ELSP context descriptor dword into Work Item.
 * See guc_add_request()
 *
