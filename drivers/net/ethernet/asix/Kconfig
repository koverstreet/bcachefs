	  Say Y here to enable SPI transfer compression. It saves up
	  to 24 dummy cycles during each transfer which may noticeably
	  speed up short transfers. This sets the default value that is
	  inherited by network interfaces during probe. It can be
	  changed at run time via spi-compression ethtool tunable.

	  If unsure say N.
