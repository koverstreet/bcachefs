=========================
octeontx2 devlink support
=========================

This document describes the devlink features implemented by the ``octeontx2 AF, PF and VF``
device drivers.

Parameters
==========

The ``octeontx2 PF and VF`` drivers implement the following driver-specific parameters.

.. list-table:: Driver-specific parameters implemented
   :widths: 5 5 5 85

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Mode
     - Description
   * - ``mcam_count``
     - u16
     - runtime
     - Select number of match CAM entries to be allocated for an interface.
       The same is used for ntuple filters of the interface. Supported by
       PF and VF drivers.

The ``octeontx2 AF`` driver implements the following driver-specific parameters.

     - runtime
     - Use to set the quantum which hardware uses for scheduling among transmit queues.
       Hardware uses weighted DWRR algorithm to schedule among all transmit queues.
