Linux Memory Management Documentation
=====================================

This is a collection of documents about the Linux memory management (mm)
subsystem internals with different level of details ranging from notes and
mailing list responses for elaborating descriptions of data structures and
algorithms.  If you are looking for advice on simply allocating memory, see the
:ref:`memory_allocation`.  For controlling and tuning guides, see the
:doc:`admin guide <../admin-guide/mm/index>`.
