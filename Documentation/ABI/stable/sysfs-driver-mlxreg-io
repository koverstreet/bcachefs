Description:	This file allows to unlock ASIC after thermal shutdown event.
		When system thermal shutdown is enforced by ASIC, ASIC is
		getting locked and after system boot it will not be available.
		Software can decide to unlock it by setting this attribute to
		1 and then perform system power cycle by setting pwr_cycle
		attribute to 1 (power cycle of main power domain).
		Before setting shutdown_unlock to 1 it is recommended to
		validate that system reboot cause is reset_asic_thermal or
		reset_thermal_spc_or_pciesw.
		In case shutdown_unlock is not set 1, the only way to release
		ASIC from locking - is full system power cycle through the
		external power distribution unit.
		Default is 1.
