Description:
		(RO) Presents SSC (spread spectrum clock) information for EMI

		=======	==========================================
		Bits	Description
		=======	==========================================
		[7:0]	Sets clock spectrum spread percentage:
			0x00=0.2% , 0x3F=10%
			1 LSB = 0.1% increase in spread (for
			settings 0x01 thru 0x1C)
			1 LSB = 0.2% increase in spread (for
			settings 0x1E thru 0x3F)
		[8]	When set to 1, enables spread
			spectrum clock
		[9]	0: Triangle mode. FFC frequency
			walks around the Fcenter in a linear
			fashion
			1: Random walk mode. FFC frequency
			changes randomly within the SSC
			(Spread spectrum clock) range
		[10]	0: No white noise. 1: Add white noise
			to spread waveform
		[11]	When 1, future writes are ignored.
