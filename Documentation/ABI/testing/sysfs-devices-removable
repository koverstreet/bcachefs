Description:
		Information about whether a given device can be removed from the
		platform by the	user. This is determined by its subsystem in a
		bus / platform-specific way. This attribute is only present for
		devices that can support determining such information:

		===========  ===================================================
		"removable"  device can be removed from the platform by the user
		"fixed"      device is fixed to the platform / cannot be removed
			     by the user.
		"unknown"    The information is unavailable / cannot be deduced.
		===========  ===================================================

		Currently this is only supported by USB (which infers the
		information from a combination of hub descriptor bits and
		platform-specific data such as ACPI) and PCI (which gets this
		from ACPI / device tree).
