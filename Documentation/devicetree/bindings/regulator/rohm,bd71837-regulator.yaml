  List of regulators provided by this controller. BD71837 regulators node
  should be sub node of the BD71837 MFD node. See BD71837 MFD bindings at
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/rohm,bd71837-pmic.yaml
  Regulator nodes should be named to BUCK_<number> and LDO_<number>. The
  definition for each of these nodes is defined using the standard
  binding for regulators at
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt.
  Note that if BD71837 starts at RUN state you probably want to use
  regulator-boot-on at least for BUCK6 and BUCK7 so that those are not
  disabled by driver at startup. LDO5 and LDO6 are supplied by those and
  if they are disabled at startup the voltage monitoring for LDO5/LDO6 will
  cause PMIC to reset.

#The valid names for BD71837 regulator nodes are:
#BUCK1, BUCK2, BUCK3, BUCK4, BUCK5, BUCK6, BUCK7, BUCK8
#LDO1, LDO2, LDO3, LDO4, LDO5, LDO6, LDO7
