      The lpddr2 node may have one or more child nodes of type "lpddr2-timings".
      "lpddr2-timings" provides AC timing parameters of the device for
      a given speed-bin. The user may provide the timings for as many
      speed-bins as is required. Please see Documentation/devicetree/
      bindings/memory-controllers/ddr/lpddr2-timings.txt for more information
      on "lpddr2-timings".
