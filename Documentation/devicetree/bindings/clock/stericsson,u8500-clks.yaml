description: While named "U8500 clocks" these clocks are inside the
  DB8500 digital baseband system-on-chip and its siblings such as
  DB8520. These bindings consider the clocks present in the SoC
  itself, not off-chip clocks. There are four different on-chip
  clocks - RTC (32 kHz), CPU clock (SMP TWD), PRCMU (power reset and
  control management unit) clocks and PRCC (peripheral reset and
  clock controller) clocks. For some reason PRCC 4 does not exist so
  the itemization can be a bit unintuitive.

  prcmu-clock:
    description: A subnode with one clock cell for PRCMU (power, reset, control
      management unit) clocks. The cell indicates which PRCMU clock in the
      prcmu-clock node the consumer wants to use.
    type: object

    properties:
      '#clock-cells':
        const: 1

    additionalProperties: false

  prcc-periph-clock:
    description: A subnode with two clock cells for PRCC (peripheral
      reset and clock controller) peripheral clocks. The first cell indicates
      which PRCC block the consumer wants to use, possible values are 1, 2, 3,
      5, 6. The second cell indicates which clock inside the PRCC block it
      wants, possible values are 0 thru 31.
    type: object

      '#clock-cells':
        const: 2

    additionalProperties: false

  prcc-kernel-clock:
    description: A subnode with two clock cells for PRCC (peripheral reset
      and clock controller) kernel clocks. The first cell indicates which PRCC
      block the consumer wants to use, possible values are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. The
      second cell indicates which clock inside the PRCC block it wants, possible
      values are 0 thru 31.
    type: object

    properties:
      '#clock-cells':
        const: 2

    additionalProperties: false

  prcc-reset-controller:
    description: A subnode with two reset cells for the reset portions of the
      PRCC (peripheral reset and clock controller). The first cell indicates
      which PRCC block the consumer wants to use, possible values are 1, 2, 3
      5 and 6. The second cell indicates which reset line inside the PRCC block
      it wants to control, possible values are 0 thru 31.
