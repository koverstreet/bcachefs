title: Texas Instruments TLV320ADCX140 Quad Channel Analog-to-Digital Converter

maintainers:
  - Dan Murphy <dmurphy@ti.com>

description: |
  The TLV320ADCX140 are multichannel (4-ch analog recording or 8-ch digital
  PDM microphones recording), high-performance audio, analog-to-digital
  converter (ADC) with analog inputs supporting up to 2V RMS. The TLV320ADCX140
  family supports line and  microphone Inputs, and offers a programmable
  microphone bias or supply voltage generation.
